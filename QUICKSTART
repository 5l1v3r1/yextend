Before you build ywrapper, you need to do three things:
- Ensure that all pre-required software installations are covered (see README for details)
- Build and install yara 3.0 on your local machine; and
- Install some of the components from the yara 3.0 build.

Note that some of these steps require root privileges.

Here are the steps:

- Get the yara 3.0 source by following this link: https://github.com/plusvic/yara/archive/v3.0.0.tar.gz

- Then do the following:

  tar xvfz v3.0.0.tar.gz
  cd yara-3.0.0
  ./bootstrap.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo cp -r libyara/include/* /usr/local/include




Now you're ready to build ywrapper.

  tar xvfz ywrapper.1.0.0.tar.gz
  cd ywrapper-1.0.0
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  ./make


The executable file ywrapper will appear in the same directory after
completing these steps.
